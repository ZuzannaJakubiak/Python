### Introduction

This repository implements an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm using backpropagation to solve a binary classification problem. The goal is to classify points as either yellow or purple based on three input variables \(x_1\), \(x_2\), and \(x_3\). An artificial neural network is employed to learn patterns in the data and predict classifications.

### Conclusions

1. **Model Effectiveness**: The ANN model achieves high accuracy in classifying the classes, indicating the network's ability to generalize and learn from the training data.
   
2. **Activation Functions**: The use of activation functions like leaky ReLU and sigmoid significantly impacts the network's ability to learn complex patterns in the data.

3. **Learning Process**: The learning process using backpropagation and gradient descent optimization is efficient, as evidenced by changes in the cost function values and the increase in accuracy over iterations.

4. **Visualization**: Visualizing data and prediction results enhances understanding of the model's performance and classification effectiveness.

5. **Opportunities for Improvement**: There are opportunities to further optimize the model by adjusting the network architecture, tuning learning parameters, and experimenting with different activation functions and optimization algorithms.
